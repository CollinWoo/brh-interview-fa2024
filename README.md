# BRH Software Team Technical Question Fall 2024

Create a web application that returns a greeting based on a response from the server.

## Server-Side
Create an endpoint that takes in a name and returns "Hello <name>!"

## Client-Side
When the Get Greeting button is clicked, send the name entered in the text input to the backend and display the returned message on the frontend. On error, display an error instead.

## Bonus
Center UI elements horizontally and vertically on the screen.
